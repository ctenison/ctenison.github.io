                </div>
                <p>Since 2021, I have led research on initiatives to support pathways into teaching through test preparation offerings. As the research lead, I have overseen the project from its inception through to its current implementation as a recognized product in the ETS marketplace. A notable achievement includes the design and launch of multiple self-paced, adaptive online test-prep courses for pre-service teachers as part of the <a href="https://praxis.ets.org/learning-paths.html">Praxis Learning Paths series</a> .
                </p>
                <p>My dual role supporting product development and efficacy research has uniquely positioned me to integrate practical application with theoretical research, ensuring that our solutions are both innovative and grounded in solid educational principles. My efforts have included leading critical studies that have shaped the product development. This includes two usability studies that directly influenced feature prioritization for both initial release and subsequent redesigns, as well as a comprehensive pilot study to refine the course design and learner dashboard. Additionally, I conducted an extensive analysis of a year’s worth of course data to derive actionable insights into user engagement and effectiveness, which informed strategic decision-making and influenced ETS’s broader teacher support strategies.
                </p>
                <p>I continue to support the Praxis program through an ongoing research collaboration with <a href="https://study.com">Study.com</a>.  This partnership explores how personalized, AI-driven learning plans can the diverse needs of teacher candidates.  As a researcher supporting this collaboration, I coordinate research efforts to meticulously analyze the relationship between course usage and performance on the Praxis Elementary Education test. Our joint efforts aim not only to address the immediate needs of test-takers but also to undertake rigorous research to understand and dismantle barriers faced by teacher candidates from various backgrounds. This research is instrumental in developing targeted interventions that improve educational outcomes and support the growth of a diverse and highly qualified teacher workforce.
                </p>
